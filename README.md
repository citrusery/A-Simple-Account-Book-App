# A-simple-account-book-app
It's a simple account-book app for Android made in 2019/7 with the  purpose of study

This app includes:

1. A logging/register interface

2. A data displaying part, a account list part and setting part: The three fragment make it that U can just slide or touch the bottom button to transfer to each other just like Wechat.

3. A account adding interface with 2 styles (half screen/full screen).

The distinguishing features:

1. A easy-reaching and good-looking UI where u can easily find what u want

2. 3 changable components where U may find U like

3. Wechat-like interface may refer to

4. Others 

NOT satisfying

1. Mess algorithm

2. Bad compatibility

3. Others 

SUM UP

This maybe a good reference if u r blank to app project. Mulitiple UI technique may u find one u like and refer to,  whereas my lack of time when coding it may fails it, which resulted in a disatisfying code collections.

Thanks to the creater of PieChartManagger, Folding Cell List and so on, though I've forgotten'em by the name because of the long period between the reference and uploading.
